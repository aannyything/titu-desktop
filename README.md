A personal coding project to build my own biography webpage — a central hub that links my socials, showcases updates, and shares who I am.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is about creating a clean, responsive, and personal biography webpage. It serves as a digital identity card, combining my story, my links, and my latest updates into one place. It’s both a learning journey and a creative experiment in front-end web development.
